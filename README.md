# Solid-Spheres-Gas-Simulation
Solid spheres (Ideal) gas simulation and further analysis.

The code plots a 3D animation using matplotlib library. The particles interact with each others given a concrete radius in a given dimensions box.
Already set for changing main parameters and further analysis, such as temperature, pressure, and velocities study with hystogram and average speed vs time.
